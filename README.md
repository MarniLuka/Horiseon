# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Description

For this project, we took an already written starter code and refactored it to meet the Acceptance Criteria. This will make it easier for another developer to make changes later on if needed. 

- All links were edited and tested to make sure they function correctly.
- HTML properties were reclassed for optimization and to follow semantic structure.
- CSS selectors and properties were reorganized and consolidated to follow semantic structure.
- Comments were also added to make it easier to follow the structure and to show some of the changes made.


## Usage

Upon accessing the Horiseon site, you will see that it's appearance hasn't changed so as to be familiar with current users. However, all the links in the nav bar are working and will direct you to the corresponding section of the website upon clicking.
